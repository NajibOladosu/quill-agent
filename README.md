# Quill

Autonomous social media agent for Najib. Runs daily via GitHub Actions — fetches recent commits from active repos, picks the most significant one, and posts a LinkedIn update and an X tweet. No interaction needed.

## How it works

1. Fetches commits from the last 48 hours across three repos: Velluma, AURA, ApplyOS
2. Filters out noise commits (chore, style, docs, merge, bump, wip)
3. Picks the highest-priority commit (feat > fix > refactor/perf > other)
4. Skips any commit SHA already in `posted_commits.txt` (deduplication)
5. Generates a LinkedIn post and X tweet using Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
6. Posts to both platforms and records the commit SHA

## Schedule

Runs automatically at **9:00 AM UTC** every day. Can also be triggered manually from the Actions tab.

## Setup

### 1. GitHub Secrets

Add these in `Settings → Secrets → Actions`:

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `LINKEDIN_TOKEN` | LinkedIn OAuth Bearer token |
| `X_AUTH_TOKEN` | X `auth_token` cookie value |
| `X_CT0` | X `ct0` cookie value (also used as CSRF token) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google AI Studio API key (free tier) |

### 2. Get a Gemini API key

Go to [aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and create a key. No billing required.

### 3. Enable Actions

Make sure GitHub Actions is enabled in the repo's Actions tab. The workflow needs `contents: write` permission (already set in the workflow file) to commit `posted_commits.txt` back after each run.

## Repo rules

| Repo | Visibility | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Velluma | Private | Never named or linked — referred to as "a tool I'm building" |
| AURA | Public | Named freely, links to `auratriage.vercel.app` |
| ApplyOS | Public | Named freely, links to `applyos.io` |

## Token expiry

LinkedIn tokens expire after ~60 days. When the run logs `LinkedIn token invalid`, refresh the token and update the `LINKEDIN_TOKEN` secret. X session cookies may also expire — update `X_AUTH_TOKEN` and `X_CT0` if X posts start failing.

## Files

- `quill.py` — main script
- `.github/workflows/quill.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow
- `posted_commits.txt` — log of posted commit SHAs (auto-updated by the workflow)
